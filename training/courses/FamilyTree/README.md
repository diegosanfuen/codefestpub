# From familyTree to DiviTree
This section introduces the purpose of the notebook: to demonstrate the use of **TIP**, the Technology Intelligence Platform, through a real life example using data from **OPS**, the EPO's Open Patent Services.

By leveraging the family method in OPS, which provides access to the **INPADOC extended patent family**, and visualizing the results with Plotly's sunburst chart, **familyTree** offers a dynamic, spherical, and interactive view of patent families. It shows relationships by branches and parent-child links in a format that can be intuitively explored through zooming and clicking. 

When applied to divisional applications, this approach is referred to as **DiviTree**, which first creates a text-based tree as illustrated in the example below:

Below is the EP family tree of patent application **EP09164213**, available at the EPO, where each of the four branches corresponds to a distinct **DOCDB simple patent family**:

**DiviTree** can further display EP/WO family members available at the EPO, along with corresponding national applications converted from EP applications:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

  <img src="images/EP09164213_EP_WO_HK_MX_SG_TW.jpg" width="500"/>
  <img src="images/EP09164213_DiviTree_EP_WO_HK_MX_SG_TW.jpg" width="600"/>
</div>

Finally, **DiviTree** can give an overview of all **INPADOC** filings found in the family of application **EP09164213**:
